I watch movies in my free time. You can check out my [Letterboxd <i class="fa-brands fa-letterboxd"></i>
account](https://letterboxd.com/shayanh/) to learn about my favorites and the
recent films I watched.

Iâ€™m a big soccer fan. I follow European soccer leagues and play soccer myself.
Besides soccer, I enjoy working out in the gym and running. I run distances up to 10k.
Follow me [on Strava <i class="fa-brands fa-strava"></i>](https://www.strava.com/athletes/78883322) if you are into running.

I spend a lot of time listening to music every day. I particularly like Persian
rock music. We have been maintaining a Persian dance playlist with some of my
friends for a few years now, which you can check it out [on
Spotify <i class="fa-brands fa-spotify"></i>](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0c6vHqSegYiJYLegscZmte?si=6555b59fadb044f2).

I don't play video games usually, but I hold a world record in a mobile game,
[Jelly Juggle <i class="fa-brands fa-app-store"></i>](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jelly-juggle/id1175902969).

I love the outdoors and hiking like most of the people living in BC.
