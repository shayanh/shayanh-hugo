I watch movies in my free time. You can check out my [Letterboxd
account](https://letterboxd.com/shayanh/) to learn about my favorites and the
recent films I watched.

Iâ€™m a big soccer fan. I follow European soccer leagues and play soccer myself.
Besides soccer, I enjoy weigh lifting and running. I run distances up to 10k.

I spend a lot of time listening to music every day. I particularly like Persian
rock music. We have been maintaining a Persian dance playlist with
some of my friends since a couple of years ago, which you can check out [on
Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0c6vHqSegYiJYLegscZmte?si=6555b59fadb044f2).

I love the outdoors and hiking, especially in the beautiful British Columbia.
