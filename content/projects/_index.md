##### Model compiler for distributed systems

Distributed systems are difficult to design and implement correctly. In
response, both research and industry are exploring applications of formal
methods to distributed systems. A key challenge in this domain is the
missing link between the formal design of a system and its implementation.
Today, practitioners bridge this link through manual effort.

We present a language called Modular PlusCal that extends PlusCal by cleanly
separating the model of a system from a model of its environment. We then
present a compiler tool-chain called PGo that automatically translates MPCal
models to TLA+ for model checking, and that also compiles MPCal models to
runnable Go code. PGo provides system designers with a new ability to model and
check their designs, and then re-use their modeling efforts to mechanically
extract runnable implementations of their designs.

##### Comparison of salaries and companies

In 2021, I started the Peydaa project. Peydaa is a non-profit platform to make
transparency in the Iranian job market. It is a website where people can
anonymously share their salary and experience of working in companies with
others. So far, more than 1000 users have shared their salaries and
experiences on Peydaa.

### gRPC Go Contracts
##### Verify the communication of your microservices

<div class="col-sm-9">

Verify the communication of your microservices by writing contracts for your
RPCs.  gRPC Go Contracts provides contract programming (aka Design by Contract)
for gRPC methods written in Go and supports preconditions and postconditions.
In the case of contract violation, it logs the contract error message and its
parameters.

<!--### Women's Movements in Iran-->

<!--</div>-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<div class="row">-->

<!--<div class="col-sm-9">-->

<!--Iranian people have been protesting all across the country since September 2022.-->
<!--What sparked these protests was the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22 year old woman,-->
<!--who was killed at the hands of the so called "morality police" due to having-->
<!--"improper" hijab. Some call this movement a revolution that is primarily led by-->
<!--youth and women, with its main slogan being "Women, Life, Freedom". In this-->
<!--project, I reviewed Iranian womenâ€™s living conditions in the past 40 years and-->
<!--provide a history of previous uprisings to better understand the underlying-->
<!--causes of one of the most significant revolutions in modern history that is-->
<!--currently happening in Iran.-->
