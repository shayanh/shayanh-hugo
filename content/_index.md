My name is Shayan Hosseini. I'm a computer science MSc student at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I'm working with [Ivan
Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/) on distributed systems and
software verification. I spent 2022 summer at Microsoft Research working on
datacenter networking problems.

I spent 5 years in industry building cloud serivces where I managed teams of size
5-10. I was an early member of the internal inftrastructure team and co-led the
transition of the team into a public cloud company, sotoon.ir.

I was an avid competitive programmer during my high school and undergrad years.
I won several awards in informatics olympiad and ACM ICPC contests.
