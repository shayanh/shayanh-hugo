My name is Shayan Hosseini.  I’m a Computer Science MSc student at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), working under the
supervision of [Prof. Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/). I
completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at the [ECE
Department](http://ece.ut.ac.ir/) of the [University of
Tehran](http://ut.ac.ir/).

From 2015 to 2020, I was working at [Cafebazaar](http://cafebazaar.ir/), the
most popular Android application store in Iran, with more than 35 million
users. During these years, I served as a Software Engineer, Product Manager,
Technical Lead, and Software Engineering Manager. One of my main contributions
was building a distributed object storage and a content delivery network.
Moreover, I was one of the co-founders of Cafebazaar Cloud, which is a
subsidiary of Cafebazaar that provides public cloud services to other companies
(rebranded as [Sotoon](https://sotoon.ir/) later).

In 2021, I started the [Peydaa](https://peydaa.ir/) project. Peydaa is a
non-profit platform to make transparency in the Iranian job market. It is a
website that people can anonymously share their salary and experience of
working in companies with others. Currently, more than 600 users have shared
their salaries and experiences on Peydaa.

I have an extensive background in algorithms, combinatorics, and graph theory.
In high school, I won silver medal in the [Iranian National Olympiad in
Informatics](http://inoi.ir/). I later achieved the 2nd place in [Tehran ACM
ICPC Regional Contest](https://icpc.ir/) twice in
[2016](http://icpc.sharif.edu/acmicpc16/scoreboard/),
[2017](http://icpc.sharif.edu/acmicpc17/scoreboard/). Also, I got 56th place in
[ICPC World Finals 2017](https://icpc.global/community/results-2017).

The research area I focus on is distributed systems. Currently, I am working on
the [PGo](https://github.com/UBC-NSS/pgo) project. PGo compiles verifiable
models of distributed systems into implementations in Go.
