My name is Shayan Hosseini, natively written as شایان حسینی.\
I’m a Computer Science MSc student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/). I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at the [ECE Department](http://ece.ut.ac.ir/) of the [University of Tehran](http://ut.ac.ir/).

From 2015 to 2020, I was working at [Cafebazaar](http://cafebazaar.ir/), the most popular Android application store in Iran, with more than 35 million users. During these years, I served as a Software Engineer, Product Manager, Technical Lead, and Software Engineering Manager. One of my main contributions was building a distributed object storage and a content delivery network. Moreover, I was one of the co-founders of Hezardastan Cloud Services, which is a subsidiary of Cafebazaar that provides public cloud services to other companies.

I have an extensive background in algorithms, combinatorics, and graph theory. In high school, I won silver medal in the [Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics](http://inoi.ir/). I later achieved the 2nd place in [Tehran ACM ICPC Regional Contest](https://icpc.ir/) twice in [2016](http://icpc.sharif.edu/acmicpc16/scoreboard/), [2017](http://icpc.sharif.edu/acmicpc17/scoreboard/). Also, I got 56th place in [ACM ICPC World Finals 2017](https://icpc.baylor.edu/community/results-2017).

The broader research area I focus on is distributed systems. In the summer of 2019, I worked as a research intern at [Max Planck Institute for Informatic](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), working on the fault-tolerant routing problem, supervised by [Prof. Christoph Lenzen](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~clenzen/).
